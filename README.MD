# fuzzy C-Means with Tabu Search
## current Problem
1. How to generate the neighbourhood with the local solution?
2. ~~How to define the tabu object, code or the mat?
if use the mat, what should we define the object, the mat itself or the area ?~~
**ASW: use mat and tabu the area of a rect around the mat(see mat as a dot in N-d space)**
3. Calc the J first or judge the tabu-list first?~~
